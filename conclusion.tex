\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in uncovering temporal properties within resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. Our research highlights TDA's robustness in the presence of varying temporal sampling rates, surpassing traditional connectivity analysis methods. Key findings emphasize TDA's remarkable stability, with 59\% of subjects consistently showing clustering results across different temporal sampling periods (2500ms, 1400ms, 645ms), compared to less than 2\% using traditional methods. TDA also reveals strong pairwise similarities between sampling periods, showcasing its ability to capture temporal dynamics. In conclusion, our study establishes TDA as a valuable tool for revealing temporal nuances in rs-fMRI data, offering a level of robustness unmatched by traditional methods. Through persistent homology, TDA provides a stable, invariant representation of dynamic brain connectivity, promising valuable insights into complex temporal patterns in resting-state fMRI data across diverse acquisition parameters.
