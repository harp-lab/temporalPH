\begin{abstract}
Based on functional connectivity networks (FCN) discovered from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), the study of brain function is gaining popularity. FCNs are susceptible to factors affecting data acquisition parameters, such as the temporal sampling period. The difference in temporal sampling rates of MRI machines negates the benefits of larger sample sizes in pooled data by introducing non-neural variability in the collected data. Preserving the topology of the FCN for different sampling periods can mitigate this issue. We use Persistent Homology (PH) to preserve the topology of the FCNs from different temporal sampling periods. Persistent homology can extract topological features which outperform graph analytics by preserving the network topology for continuous time series data. The persistent diagrams represent the topological features and are compared using the Wasserstein distance metric. We presented a novel Topological Data Analysis (TDA) framework that is applied on $371,616$ adjacency matrices extracted from three temporal sampling periods ($2500ms$, $1400ms$, $645ms$) of rs-fMRI datasets collected from 316 subjects proving the robustness of persistent homology to a specific data acquisition parameter (temporal sampling period). Using statistical analysis, we evaluated the resiliency of our TDA framework on different temporal sampling periods of rs-fMRI datasets.


% There is increasing interest in investigating brain function based on functional connectivity networks (FCN) obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). FCNs, typically obtained using measures of time series association such as Pearsonâ€™s correlation, are sensitive to data acquisition parameters such as sampling period. This introduces non-neural variability in data pooled from different acquisition protocols and MRI scanners, negating the advantages of larger sample sizes in pooled data. To address this, we hypothesize that the topology or shape of brain networks must be preserved irrespective of how densely it is sampled, and metrics which capture this topology may be statistically similar across sampling periods, thereby alleviating this source of non-neural variability. Accordingly, we present an end-to-end pipeline that uses persistent homology, a branch of topological data analysis, to demonstrate \emph{similarity} across FCNs acquired at different temporal sampling periods. Persistent homology (PH) as a technique extracts topological features by capturing the network organization across all continuous threshold values, as opposed to graph theoretic methods, which fix a discrete network topology by thresholding the connectivity matrix. The extracted topological features are encoded in the form of persistent diagrams that can be compared against one another using the earth-moving metric, also popularly known as the Wasserstein distance. We extract topological features from three data cohorts, each acquired at different temporal sampling periods and demonstrate that these features are statistically the same, hence, empirically showing that PH is invariant to data acquisition parameters such as sampling period.
